    <h2>Bees in the city</h2>
    <p>This site is about one of my biggest hobbies - except for collecting cat figuers - beekeeping in the city where I live!
To get you all started I've put together some tips and tricks for how to do it if you have never tried before. It's so simple and fun - you'll love it!
What you need first is a stable, safe location for city bees. Make sure the hive is sheltered from strong wind and accessible for regular inspections. Make sure to monitor the hive activity, offer supplemental feeding during harsh seasons, and avoid areas with heavy pollution.</p>
